    "title": "Insecure algorithm specified for SecretKeySpec and insecure key generation and management",
    "explanation": "Specifying the RC5 algorithm for cryptographic operations is insecure due to known vulnerabilities in the algorithm that can be exploited. Furthermore, the code demonstrates potential misuse in the management of secret keys, such as relying on static passwords, which can lead to predictable and easily exploitable cryptographic keys.",
