    },
    {
        "title": "Insecure Salt Usage in Cryptographic Operations",
        "explanation": "Using static or insufficient-length salts in cryptographic operations like key derivation undermines security. Salts should be unique, cryptographically random, and at least 128 bits long to prevent precomputation attacks like rainbow table attacks."

    {
        "title": "Hardcoded Cryptographic Secrets",
        "explanation": "Hardcoding cryptographic keys, nonces, and passwords directly in the source code is a severe security risk.

    },
    {
        "title": "Improper Initialization Vector (IV) Usage",
        "explanation": "Multiple instances show the use of hardcoded, static, or improperly generated IVs. This practice compromises the security of encryption by making it vulnerable to various attacks, including ciphertext and chosen-plaintext attacks. IVs should be randomly generated and unique for each encryption operation to ensure the security strength of the cipher mode."
