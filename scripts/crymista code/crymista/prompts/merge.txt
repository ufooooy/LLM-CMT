You will receive a JSON list containing cryptographic API misuses. 
Each entry represents a misuse with "instance_id" is its identity in this list, "abstract" as a brief description, and "detail" as a detailed description.
You should summarize this cryptographic API misuse list and export the result based on the following requirements:
1) You are required to merge entries that are expressed differently but share the same meaning in terms of cryptographic API misuse. 
Summarize them into one based on their "abstract" and "detail" fields, and output the result in the following format: ```json[{"instances":[instance_id1, instance_id2], "title":"", "explanation":""}, ...]```,
where each dictionary element represents misuses of the same meaning, with "title" as a brief summary and "explanation" as a detailed explanation, and the "instances" field lists their identities.
Don't forget to start with "```json" and end with "```".
2) You can briefly describe the merger you made and explain the reasons for the classification.
The content of the cryptographic API misuses JSON list is as follows:
