You will receive a JSON list of specific cryptographic API misuses and a set of terms summarizing the key causes of cryptographic API misuses.
Each entry in the JSON list has a 'title' field that represents a summary of the cryptographic API misuse, while the 'explanation' provides a detailed description.
You task is to arrange all these misuses to construct a comprehensive hierarchy taxonomy of cryptographic API misuses referring to these terms. 
Follow the instructions below:
1) Categorization: Group the misuses based on their generic causes. Name each category according to the nature of the misuses it includes, using the provided terms or creating new ones as necessary.
2) Inclusion: Ensure every misuse listed in the JSON is categorized in your taxonomy.
3) Formatting: Structure your taxonomy clearly. Begin and end the taxonomy with "```". Use "###" followed by numbers (e.g., "1.", "2.") for main categories. Use "####" followed by numbers (e.g., "1.1", "1.2") for subcategories. List specific misuse cases with a dash, starting with the misuse title in bold, followed by a detailed explanation.
Your taxonomy should be well-organized, with each category and subcategory clearly described to highlight the common themes or issues among the misuses they contain.
