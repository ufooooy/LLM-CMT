You will receive a JSON list containing cryptographic API misuses. 
Each entry represents a misuse with "abstract" as a brief description, "detail" as a detailed description, and "codes" as the list of code files where the misuse is found.
You should summarize this cryptographic API misuse list and export the result based on the following requirements:
1) You are required to merge entries with the same meaning of cryptographic API misuses, based on their "abstract" and "detail" fields. 
If several cryptography API misuses have the same meaning, summarize their "abstract" into a common "abstract", combine and summarize their "detail" fields, and merge their "codes" list.
2) You should export the resulting list of JSON objects using the same format as the original list and summarize the changes you make to the original list. 
The format of the resulting list is  ```json[{"abstract":"","detail":"","codes":["",]},]```.
The content of the cryptographic API misuses JSON list is as follows:
