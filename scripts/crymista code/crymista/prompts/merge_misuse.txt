You will receive two cryptographic API misuses in JSON format. 
Each misuse includes a "title" for a brief description and an "explanation" summarizing the causes, effects, or specific conditions. 
Although there are two cases, they essentially refer to the same cryptographic API misuse in terms of meaning.
Since that, your task is to summarize the two cryptographic API misuses into one based on their "title" and "explanation", and output in the following format: ```json[{"title":"", "explanation":""}]```
The content of the first cryptographic API misuse is as follows:
${misuse1}
The content of the second cryptographic API misuse is as follow:
${misuse2}
